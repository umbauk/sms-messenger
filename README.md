## Installation & Local Startup

### Server

_Note: You will need a .env file in the root directory containing the Twilio and Mongo Cloud credentials_

In the root directory, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode on `http://localhost:3001`

### Client

In the `/client` directory run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the client in development mode on `http://localhost:3000`.

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to use the app.

_Note: `npm run build` builds the React app for production in the /build folder._

## Instructions

You can register a new user or click the `Demo` button on the login page to see an account with customers and messages.

You can add new numbers in the sidebar (_Note: because this is using a Twilio trial account, any new numbers need to also be added in the Twilio console by me and confirmed with an SMS code_)

In the Demo account you can send messages to the existing customers (Picard and Janeway) and the messages will come to me. If I see them I'll reply and you can see the sockets in action!

## What I'd do if I had more time

- Write tests
- Do better error handling and data checking (e.g. you can add invalid phone numbers)
- Add new unread message markers in the sidebar
- Handle multiple users having a customer with the same phone number
